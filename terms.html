      <h1>Terms of Service Agreement for wildworks.com</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content-txt">
      <h2>1.  INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>PLEASE READ THESE ONLINE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY (we call them "TOS" for short). They are your roadmap for visiting wildworks.com (collectively, we will call wildworks.com web pages the “Site”), and they tell you what you can and cannot do while on our Site. The Site is owned by WildWorks, Inc.; formerly known as Smart Bomb Interactive. You can call us "WildWorks," we will call you "you.”  If you use our Site, that means that you understand and agree to this TOS, and to other rules we may have or create from time to time.</p>
<p>Your use of our Site is subject to this TOS. If you do not understand or agree with this TOS, please do not use the Site.</p>
<p>Note that special terms apply to some services offered on other sites controlled by WildWorks, including subscription-based services and games, rules for particular contests or sweepstakes, or other features or activities.  Those terms are posted in connection with the applicable service.  Any such terms are in addition to these terms of use, and in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms of use.</p>
<p>This Agreement requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p>This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of you and WildWorks with respect to the Site.</p>
<h2>2.  USE OF CONTENT</h2>
<p>All information, materials, functions and other content (including Submissions, as defined in Section 3, entitled "SUBMISSIONS") ("<strong>Content</strong>") contained on our Site are our copyrighted property or the copyrighted property of our licensors or licensees.  All trademarks, service marks, trade names, and trade dress are proprietary to us and/or our licensors or licensees.  We may change the Site or delete Content or features at any time, in any way, for any or no reason.</br>
The rights granted to you in this Agreement are subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Site or any WildWorks services; (b) you shall not modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of the Site or services, except to the extent the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law; (c) you shall not access the Site in order to build a similar or competitive service or application; (d) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Site may be copied, reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any means, or (e) you shall not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in the Site. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Site shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement, unless otherwise provided in terms associated with such addition.  All copyright and other proprietary notices on any Site content must be retained on any copies.</p>
<p>In the event that we offer downloads of software from our Site and you download such software, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively, the "<strong>Software</strong>") are licensed to you by us or third-party licensors for your personal, noncommercial home use only.  We do not transfer title to the Software to you. You may not distribute or otherwise exploit the Software or decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-readable form.</p>
<h2>3.  SUBMISSIONS</h2>
<p>In these TOS, we use the word "<strong>Submissions</strong>" to mean text, messages, ideas, concepts, pitches, suggestions, stories, screenplays, treatments, formats, artwork, photographs, drawings, videos, audiovisual works, musical compositions (including lyrics), sound recordings, characterizations, your and/or other persons' names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions, appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or material, and/or other similar materials that you submit, post, upload, embed, display, communicate or otherwise distribute (collectively, "<strong>Distribute</strong>") on or through our Site.</br>
There are two types of Submissions:  Solicited Submissions and Unsolicited Submissions. "<strong>Solicited Submissions</strong>" means those Submissions that we expressly request or enable you to provide to us via any feature or activity through our Site for our review or display; "<strong>Unsolicited Submissions</strong>" are any and all Submissions that do not fall within the definition of Solicited Submissions in this Paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS; NO IMPLIED CONTRACT.</strong></br>
Our company policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited Submissions, so please do not Distribute Unsolicited Submissions via email, electronic message, or through our Site or any of our services.  We want to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by us or under our direction might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work.  We therefore ask that you not send us or Distribute any Unsolicited Submission.  In any event, you agree that any Submission you make is not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type.</p>
<p>Except as expressly stated in these terms of use, the provisions of these terms of use apply equally to Unsolicited Submissions and Solicited Submissions.  Accordingly, we, our licensees, licensors, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users shall be entitled to exploit and disclose all Submissions, and we shall not be liable to you or to any person claiming through you for any exploitation or disclosure of any Submission.</p>
<h2>4.  LICENSES AND REPRESENTATIONS</h2>
<p>You hereby grant us and our licensors, licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable (in whole or part) worldwide license under all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, privacy and publicity rights and other intellectual property rights you own or control to use, reproduce, transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, modify (including removing lyrics and music from any Submission or substituting the lyrics and music in any Submission with music and lyrics selected by us), create derivative works based upon, perform and otherwise exploit such Submissions, in whole or in part, in all media formats and channels now known or hereafter devised (including on WildWorks web sites and third party web sites), for any and all purposes including entertainment, news, advertising, promotional, marketing, publicity, trade or commercial purposes, all without further notice to you, with or without attribution, and without the requirement of any permission from or payment to you or to any other person or entity (the "<strong>Submissions License</strong>").</p>
<p>By communicating a Submission, you represent and warrant that the Submission and your communication thereof conform to the Rules of Conduct (set forth below in Section 6 labeled "RULES OF CONDUCT") and other requirements of these TOS and that you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, consents and permissions, without the need for any permission from or payment to any other person or entity, to exploit, and to authorize us to exploit, such Submission in all manners contemplated by these terms of use (including the Submissions License). These terms of use (including the Submissions License) do not limit any past or future grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers you may have made or make with respect to Submissions.</p>
<p>You hereby appoint us as your agent with full power to enter into and execute any document and/or do any act we may consider appropriate to confirm the grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers set forth in these terms of use.</p>
<p>To the extent any "moral rights," "ancillary rights," or similar rights in or to the Submissions exist and are not exclusively owned by us, you agree not to enforce any such rights as to us or our licensors, licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, and you shall procure the same agreement not to enforce from any others who may possess such rights.</p>
<h2>5.  PUBLIC FORUMS AND COMMUNICATION</h2>
<p>"<strong> Public Forum </strong>" means an area, site or feature offered as part of our Site or any of our services that offers the opportunity for users to Distribute Submissions for viewing by one or more users of the services, including a chat area, message board, virtual world, instant messaging, mobile messaging, social community environment, profile page, conversation page, blog, e-mail function (including electronic greeting cards and send-a-friend e-mails).</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Public Forums and features offered therein are for public and not private communications, and you have no expectation of privacy with regard to any Submission to a public Forum. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose through any of these media; you make such disclosures at your own risk.</p>
<p>You are and shall remain solely responsible for the Submissions you Distribute on or through any services under your username or otherwise by you in any Public Forum and for the consequences of submitting and posting same. We have no duty to monitor any Public Forum.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for, and we do not endorse, the opinions, advice or recommendations posted or sent by users in any Public Forum and we specifically disclaim any and all liability in connection therewith.</p>
<p>We owe you no obligation, and therefore may refuse to post, deliver, remove, modify or otherwise use or take any action with respect to Submissions you Distribute.</p>

THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION AND ELSEWHERE IN THESE TERMS OF USE APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
<h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
  Except for either party’s claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, any and all disputes between you and WildWorks arising under or related in any way to this Agreement, must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this section.  This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly.  It includes, but is not limited to, all claims and disputes relating to your use of any of the Services and any App.</br>
  YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WILDWORKS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.  YOU AND WILDWORKS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</br>
The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this section. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the AAA, you and WILDWORKS must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in Salt Lake City, UT.  The arbitrator’s ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court, then the disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed solely and exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, USA without giving effect to any law that would result in the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>
<p>11a. &nbsp;<strong>Severability</strong>. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
</p>

<p>This Agreement is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to WILDWORKS (if any) and/or by posting notice of the changes on our website.  Any changes to this Agreement will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our website.
